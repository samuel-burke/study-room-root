## How Study Room protects members

| Risk                                  | Control                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acting as another member              | The server takes the user id from the authenticated Root connection only. No request contains a user id.                                                                                                                  |
| Touching another member's goals       | Every goal operation checks ownership; "missing" and "not yours" return the same error.                                                                                                                                   |
| Leaking private goals                 | Room state is built with private goal text removed. Personal data is broadcast only to the member's own devices.                                                                                                          |
| Malicious input                       | Goal text is length-limited and stripped of control, zero-width and bidi-override characters. Ids, numbers and booleans are type- and range-checked on the server. Settings from Root are parsed defensively and clamped. |
| Injection                             | All database access goes through knex with bound parameters. React escapes all rendered text; there is no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.                                                                                      |
| Mentions or markup in channel posts   | Nicknames and boss names are stripped of mention and markdown characters (such as `@`, `<`, `>`, `*`, `#`) before posting.                                                                                                |
| Abuse and spam                        | Per-user rate limits on every request. Busy-room posts have a cool-down.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Error details leaking                 | Unexpected errors return a generic message; the stack is logged server-side. Logs contain ids and counts, never goal text.                                                                                                |
| Secrets                               | The Root dev token lives in `server/.env`, which is git-ignored. `.env.example` documents it without a value.                                                                                                             |
| Third-party requests from inside Root | Fonts are bundled; the client makes no requests except through the Root SDK.                                                                                                                                              |
| Permissions                           | The manifest asks only for `channelView` and `channelCreateMessage`, for posting recaps.                                                                                                                                  |
| Supply chain                          | Dependabot, dependency review on pull requests, CodeQL, and pinned Root SDK versions.                                                                                                                                     |

## Known advisories

`npm audit` reports advisories in packages installed by Root's SDK, which we can't change without leaving the SDK's tested configuration:

- `sqlite3@5.1.7` (required by `@rootsdk/server-app`) depends on `node-gyp` and old `tar` releases. These run only when sqlite3 is compiled from source at install time; they aren't used at runtime.
- `uuid@10` (required by `@rootsdk/server-app` and `@rootsdk/client-app`): the advisory affects the v3/v5/v6 functions with a caller-provided buffer, which Study Room doesn't use.

We'll pick up fixed versions as Root updates the SDK.
