# Client/server API

The contract is `networking/src/studyroom.proto`. `npm run generate` turns it into TypeScript in `networking/gen/` (client, server and shared message types). The `contract` package maps those messages to the engine's DTOs.

## Conventions

- **Identity** comes from the authenticated Root connection (`client.userId` on the server). No request carries a user id, so a member can only act as themselves.
- **Timestamps** are Unix epoch milliseconds in `double` fields (exact up to 2^53), avoiding int64-as-string handling.
- **Enums** have an `UNSPECIFIED = 0` value. Decoders map unknown values to safe states (idle, break).
- **Optional fields**: `goals_private` on start requests is `optional`: unset means "keep my current choice". `goal_prompt` on a personal result is absent when there's no open goal.

## Broadcasts (server → client)

| Event                       | Sent to               | When                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `RoomUpdated` (`RoomState`) | everyone              | After any change to the board, timer, boss or settings                        |
| `PhaseCompleted`            | everyone              | A room phase ended: round, finisher ids, combo, damage, new room state        |
| `PersonalResult`            | that member's devices | After a focus block you took part in: XP math, streak, goal prompt, break end |
| `MyStatus`                  | that member's devices | After a change to your status, goals or XP (keeps your other devices in sync) |
| `BadgesEarned`              | that member's devices | Badge ids you just earned (the catalog lives in `@studyroom/core`)            |

Badges are also carried in `MyStatus.new_badge_ids`, on the reply to the action that earned them and on the status push, so the unlock still plays if the `BadgesEarned` push is lost. The client shows each badge once however many ways it arrives.

`RoomState` never contains another member's private goal text, XP total or goal list.

## Errors

Failures reach the client as `RootServerException` with a `code` and a message safe to show:

| Code | Meaning                                                                                           |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1001 | Validation failed (the message says what to fix)                                                  |
| 1002 | Not found (also used for "not yours", so ids can't be probed)                                     |
| 1003 | Conflict, e.g. starting a solo timer while on the room timer                                      |
| 1004 | Rate limited (per user: 20 writes in a burst, refilling at 2 per second; reads 30 / 5 per second) |
| 1500 | Unexpected server error. Details are logged on the server, never sent to the client               |
| 503  | The server is still starting                                                                      |

Root's own negative codes (timeouts, rate limits) are shown to members as a generic "couldn't reach Study Squad" message.
